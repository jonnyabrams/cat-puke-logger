# Cat Puke Logger

This was me messing around with React while trying to familiarise myself with it for another project. There was however a serious edge to the Cat Puke Logger - after all, why waste hundreds on unnecessary vet bills when your cat could be puking a perfectly normal amount?

With the Cat Puke Logger, you can track the nature, consistency and date/time of your cat's pukes, with the optional extra of marking them as urgent. Should you dwell on this and decide that a particular puke was nothing to worry about, there is a simple toggle on/off functionality to de-escalate the urgency of a puke.
